  PDTRow: (PriceDiscountTax)
  orderEntry.getxxxPrice(), orderEntry.getTaxValues(), orderEntry.getDiscountValues(): 
    final result: 1 price, multiple taxes, multiple discounts
    result after Europe1PriceFactory run filtering/matching
  an orderEntry has taxValues()/discountValues() => co matched tax/discount
  TaxValue/DiscountValue apply(): apply for the tax/discount for the specific quantity, price, country (convertion rate) => get appliedValue() to get the real number.
