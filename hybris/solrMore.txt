solr next
  solr data import (e.g. from relational db - chapter 12)
  say, index contains (indexed) documents
  
running solr
  solr instance: solr directory - say solr home server for examples
  change default port (8983)
  core/instance(s): each core has own dir (under solr dir) with config and data
    say, a core for houses and a core for land listing
	schema.xml: configuration for indexing
	solrconfig.xml
  
query
  solr query form: query parameters
  ranking with score, boot score ipod^2
  admin and solritas
  facet: group to help user refine (keep explore) the result
  admin tools, core tools


concepts
  full-text search: search all text (not specific column)
  document: datasource (relational db, nosql db, text files...) => documents (fields with value) => indexing with solr
  schema.xml: contain fields type
  say, mapping documents to an inverted index - single terms along with (contained document. position)
  (search terms): require, optional, negate
  phrase => search using term position
  group expression
  fuzzy matching
    wildcard - not work for phare search e.g. "*ing hou?e" => store entire phrase as a term
	leading wildcard e.g. *ence - expensive => using ReversedWildCardFilterFactory (config - double index)
	range query: price:[10 TO 20] or price:[10 TO 20}
	edit-distance searching (based on Damerau-Levenshtein distances): e.g. adapt~2 say administrator is one distance away from the original word: administrator - should limit tu 2 tro xuong
	proximity searching: "chef officer"~1 - chef and officer max 1 distance away
  relevancy - Similarity classes - scoring algorithm
    term vector for the query
	term vector for each document
	small angel => more similar
	details (later)
  accuracy
    precision: correct return/total return (1 found, 1 corect -> 1.0 - thieu cung ok) => co chinh xac ko?
    recall: correct return/all corect => co miss nhieu ko?
	how to increase both? => boots high scores len top pages (high Precision) and included poor scores (high Recall)
  searching at scale (documents number and query number)
    denormailize documents: self contained - all info of the document inside itself (duplicated between documents) vs relation (foreign key) in ralational db
	=> extremely scability horizontally with multiple server - distributed searching
	say, each server - multi cores, each core - one index => aggregate result
	solr scales nearly linear

configuration
  start server 
  ->read solr.xml: system configuration
  ->read core.properties for earch core - auto discover core (otherwise must config in solr.xml)
      name, core config file, data, log...
  ->read solrconfig.xml

populator and converter
  controller
    will use facade
	  that will use converter
	    that will use populator/other converter
		  that will use other populator
  data object (e.g. ProductData - dto - defined as bean)
  say, converter return target(xxxData) object - used in ui, populator just populate()- filling up some part of data object
  converter: convert model to data object - not have .java class, just a bean (Converter type) - contains other converters/populators - used in Facade
  populator: used by converter to fill info from model to data object
  converter should use populator, not vice versa - ProductDetailsConverter (tuong ung tren ui) should use ProductPricePopulator + ProductBasicInfoConverter??? - contains other populators
  how to use?
    define populator (java code)
	define converter (spring bean with list of populators)
	call converter.convert()
  ProductOption enum

  cleanup savedvalues and savedvalueentry
    item
      each will helds savedvalues (not impex)
  	  each will helds savedvalueentries (changed attrs)
    how? - built in (hmc.storing.modifiedvalues.size and CleanupSavedValuesStrategy) only clean up SavedValues
      default: max 20 editor - can override: hmc.storing.modifiedvalues.size
  	  or using cronjob with CleanupSavedValuesStrategy (same effect but can run by yourself)
  	  truong hop current table already have edited items over threadhold -> next change or run cron job

search mechanisms
  only search for items
  flexible search
    hac/using api (flexibleSearchService)
	search context: current session (with current user) => same query => differ result
	  effect by: type access rights (these affect the Backoffice search results only), restrictions, catalog versions, and categories
	  default is based on annonymous => need to set session user
	syntax: https://help.hybris.com/1808/hcd/8bc399c186691014b8fce25e96614547.html
	  {Product!} => no sub types
	disable caching: apply cho query that cache ko co tac dung - search theo time change frequently (differ moi lan search)
	paging support
