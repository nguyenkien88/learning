who can create quote?
  buyer e.g. when they place an order with a really big quantity and want a special price
  or sales rep  (using asm)

the process?
  used in negotiation process
  say, buyer submit a quote request (cart value more than a amount (default: $25000 - include promotion)) to negociate the final price 
    then the sales rep adjust (add/remove product, add expiry date, comment...)
    and submit the verndor quote to seller approval (if the quote value exeed the vendor threshold, if not => auto approved)
      if reject -> send back to sales rep
      if approve -> send to buyer
        if reject -> send to sales rep
        if agree -> checkout (converted to an normal order)
  quote (create by buyer) vs vendor quote (the quote that sent back to buyer)
