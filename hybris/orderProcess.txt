  multi-step-checkout-config.xml: steps before place order
  order-process.xml: after place order (start order-process by creating event with OrderProcessModel) - run by process engine

process engine - dynamic process definition
  how to create a process?
    using impex: DynamicProcessDefinition
    or declare an bean of de.hybris.platform.processengine.definition.ProcessDefinitionResource with specific xxprocess.xml
  start process
    e.g. get process name (baseStore.getSubmitOrderProcess) => BusinessProcessService.startProcess
  Action node: 3 standard actions and custom action 
  Wait node
    event...then...
    event with choice...then...
    timeout...then...
  Notify node
  End node
  Sub process
  ProcessDefinitionFactory creates the process definition when call BusinessProcessService.startProcess
  change and start process at runtime using backoffice
