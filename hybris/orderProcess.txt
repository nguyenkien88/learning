checkout-step vs order process
  multi-step-checkout-config.xml: steps before place order
  order-process.xml: after place order (start order-process by creating event with OrderProcessModel) - run by process engine

process engine - dynamic process definition
  how to create a process?
    using impex: DynamicProcessDefinition
	or declare an bean of de.hybris.platform.processengine.definition.ProcessDefinitionResource with specific xxprocess.xml
  start process
    e.g. get process name (baseStore.getSubmitOrderProcess) => BusinessProcessService.startProcess
  Action node: 3 standard actions and custom action 
  Wait node
    event...then...
	event with choice...then...
	timeout...then...
  Notify node
  End node
  Sub process
  ProcessDefinitionFactory creates the process definition when call BusinessProcessService.startProcess
  change and start process at runtime using backoffice

hybris pricing
  all about: PRICE, TAX, DISCOUNT of product
  isCalculated (Cart, Order, CartEntry, OrderEntry) -> trigger manualy theo business logic  CalculateService.calculate()
  pricing
    handle by europe1 extentions
	represent by PriceRow (potential price)
	  a price can be set different for channel (mobile, desktop), user, UserPriceGroup (vay moi goi la potential price)
	  say, with a customer, a product co the co nhieu PriceRow match -> filter to get the most relevance
	  scale price: buy 1 => 100 each, buy 10 => 95 each
	  net price: not including tax
	  gross price: including tax - https://help.sap.com/doc/011000358700001385532009e/8.82/en-US/HowTo_GrossPrices_88.pdf
	  currency conversion: auto by conversion rate
	  unitFactor: 100usd for 5 pieces
	  say, calculate price of a PriceRow
	  use BigDecimal for price with scale factor - jdbcmappings.big_decimal_scale (properties)
	  create list of PriceRow(europe1Prices) for ProductModel
	  => cuoi cung the factory will get the most relevance PriceRow (base on the product and current customer) - only 1 final price
	  see more: https://mjyothula.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/price-factory/
	tax calculation: all taxes of a product represent by TaxRow - getEurope1Taxes()
	  tuong tu PriceRow - potential tax
	  tax (and discount) is accumulate - apply nhieu tax (say, a TaxRow apply for customer/cg and product/pg - if non set) => apply for all
	  isAbsolute: chuyen nganh thue - thue tuyet doi la thue tinh ra so tien cu the e.g. 100bth, thue tuong doi: tinh theo % gia tri hang hoa => neo dung absolute = true (confirm)
	discount calculation: DiscountRow - potential, say, a discount is assigned to Product/pg or Customer/cg
	  similar to tax
	PDTRow: (PriceDiscountTax)
	orderEntry.getxxxPrice(), orderEntry.getTaxValues(), orderEntry.getDiscountValues(): 
	  final result: 1 price, multiple taxes, multiple discounts
	  result after Europe1PriceFactory run filtering/matching
	an orderEntry has taxValues()/discountValues() => co matched tax/discount
	TaxValue/DiscountValue apply(): apply for the tax/discount for the specific quantity, price, country (convertion rate) => get appliedValue() to get the real number.
  override price calculation: cartentry/orderentry: PriceFactory - default implementation is Europe1PriceFactory
    getBasePrice() 
    getTaxValues()
	getDiscountValues()
