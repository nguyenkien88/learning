product catalog (products) vs content catalog (layout)
brief summary
  the active catalog version e.g. online contains categories/products that will be shown to frontend
  the inactive catalog version e.g. summer, winter, staged contains categories/products (can different among) that will be synchronized to Online at specific time
  a category belongs to 1 catalog version in turn belongs to 1 catalog

product catalog module
  holding, structuring and managing products and product information
  say, products are organized into catalog systems
  terms: product, category, catalog, catalog version, synchronize catalog version, classification

structuring products with categories (hierachy structure)
  categories: e.g. shirts, jackets
    say, add a category to a catalog version (not a catalog) - rootCategories of a catalog version
    CategoryProductRelation: many to many
    how to create products/categories? through 3rd (erp...), Product Information System (PIM), file import (categories.impex) or create manually
    thong thuong lay theo the expectation from frontend navigation
    nested categories allowed: e.g. processors cat contains - intel cat and amd cat
	control the visibility of category: e.g. allowedPrincipals to customergroup only
	catetory media: categories_media.impex
	productcockpit (productmanager/1234)
  catalog versions
    container that contains categories
	multiple catalog versions in 1 catalog: e.g. codengaiProductCatalog catalog contains 2 versions: Staged and Online
	co the co nhieu hon 2 verions, tuy business purpose, only 1 is active at a time (for frontend)
	  e.g. Staged and Online catalog versions for editing purpose
	  Summer, Winter and Online catalog versions for seasonal purpose: when summer -> synchronize Summer catalog version to Online version (the active)
    synchronize catalog versions: source and target catalog version
	  can applied only for specific category/product
	  by default only affected the categories/products that are exist in both catalog version, other do not touch
	  can config to remove the products/categories that in the target but not in the source e.g. truong hop summer, winter, online -> sync summer to online, should remove the winter related
	synchronize catalog versions between 2 different catalogs?

multiple catalogs?
  when? use case
    muon 1 site cho My ban category 1 and 2, 1 site cho Viet Name ban category a and b
	2 sites nay active dong thoi (ko dung catalog version duoc)
	=> multiple catalogs
	conclusion: when run nhieu sites dong thoi => multiple catalogs, moi catalog cho moi site
  recommend for complex catalogs system: https://help.sap.com/viewer/d0224eca81e249cb821f2cdf45a82ace/1905/en-US/8c0c3e6d86691014aa39adc69c2502c1.html
  
product attribute definition: 2 methods - type system and classification
  type system
    see typesystem.txt 
	e.g. product A belongs to Category B which belongs to CatalogVersion C which belongs to ProductCatalog D
  classification - another way to group products
    classification attribute: say, create a classification attribute e.g. color and link to the products/categories that have that atribute
	classification category/class: hold classification atribute e.g. same as normal type system category
	when?
      when we need to define product attribute only for selected number of products rather than defining for each and every product
      when we are not sure about the lifetime of the attribute which may become unnecessary after few weeks or months.
      when we need to add product attributes dynamically at runtime.
    impex
	  category classification: a product belongs to some classificationclass which have folowwing related model
	    ClassificationSystem (similar to ProductCatalog) e.g. GSLS_Classification - contains nhieu versions, 1 active
        ClassificationSystemVersion e.g. 1.0 contains nhieu ClassificationClass
	    ClassificationClass: (similar to category) group nhieu attribute into a class e.g. GENERAL_ATTRIBUTE - assign to product, say a product A belongs to classification class A
	    ClassificationAttribute (feature) e.g. color, size, say, product A has feature B with value (ClassificationAttributeValue) C
	    ClassificationAttributeAssignment: link the class and attribute
	    ClassificationAttributeUnit
		ClassificationAttributeValue
		AttributeValueAssignment
		Feature?
		FeatureList?
	how to get classification attribute (and value) from a product?
	  productModel -> get ProductFeatureModel(s) -> get ClassAttributeAssignmentModel -> getclassificationAttribute
	  DefaultClassificationService.getFeatures()
	    productModel -> get classificationClasses (category) for that product => get all ClassAttributeAssignmentModel for that class => FeatureList for that product

		getClass().getSimpleName(), getCode(), getValues()

variant product
  say, a product (base product) holds product variants
  variant to base product: many to one
  VariantCategory (Color, Size - base product has this)
  VariantValueCategory (Red/Black, Small/Large - variant products have this)
  Get all variants => join or baseProducts.getVariants


catalog aware item type (aware for synchronize) and catalog unaware (not aware for synchronize, should not be different between 2 versions)
