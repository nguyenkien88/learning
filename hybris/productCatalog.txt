product catalog (products) vs content catalog (layout)
brief summary
  the active catalog version e.g. online contains categories/products that will be shown on frontend
  the inactive catalog version e.g. summer, winter, staged contains categories/products (can different among) that will be synchronized to Online at specific time
  a category belongs to 1 catalog version in turn belongs to 1 catalog

product catalog module
  holding, structuring and managing products and product information
  say, products are organized into catalog systems
  terms: product, category, catalog, catalog version, synchronize catalog version, classification

structuring products with categories (hierachy structure)
  categories: e.g. shirts, jackets
    say, add a category to a catalog version (not a catalog) - rootCategories of a catalog version
    CategoryProductRelation: many to many
    how to create products/categories? through 3rd (erp...), Product Information System (PIM), file import (categories.impex) or create manually
    thong thuong lay theo the expectation from frontend navigation
    nested categories allowed: e.g. processors cat contains - intel cat and amd cat
	control the visibility of category: e.g. allowedPrincipals to customergroup only
	catetory media: categories_media.impex
	productcockpit (productmanager/1234)
  catalog versions
    container that contains categories
	multiple catalog versions in 1 catalog: e.g. codengaiProductCatalog catalog contains 2 versions: Staged and Online
	co the co nhieu hon 2 verions, tuy business purpose, only 1 is active at a time (for frontend)
	  e.g. Staged and Online catalog versions for editing purpose
	  Summer, Winter and Online catalog versions for seasonal purpose: when summer -> synchronize Summer catalog version to Online version (the active)
    synchronize catalog versions: source and target catalog version
	  can applied only for specific category/product
	  by default only affected the categories/products that are exist in both catalog version, other do not touch
	  can config to remove the products/categories that in the target but not in the source e.g. truong hop summer, winter, online -> sync summer to online, should remove the winter related
	synchronize catalog versions between 2 different catalogs?

  recommend for complex catalogs system: https://help.sap.com/viewer/d0224eca81e249cb821f2cdf45a82ace/1905/en-US/8c0c3e6d86691014aa39adc69c2502c1.html
  
product attribute definition: 2 methods - type system and classification
  type system: see typesystem.txt
  classification
  
  

 
  
  catalog aware item type(aware for synchronize) and catalog unaware (not aware for synchronize, should not be different

  multi-dementional product: many size e.g. shoes
  
  
variant product
  say, a product holds product variants
  Variant to baseproduct: one to many
  VariantCategory (Color, Size - base product has this)
  VariantValueCategory (Red/Black, Small/Large - variant products have this)
  Get all variants => join or baseProducts.getVariants
