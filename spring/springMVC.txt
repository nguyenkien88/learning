Request life cycle
  front controller (DispatcherSevrlet)
  Controller
  handler mapping
  model and view name (logical name)
  ViewResolver (map to real view implementation)
  
Web context (DispatcherSevrlet application context - handler mapping, controller, view resolver) 
  vs application context (ContextLoaderListener - other beans: data, service) 
  component scan config
  view resolver config
  static resources config
  
Controller
  @Controller => bean for application context
  @RequestMapping: class level and method level
  using Model and Map for ui model
  pass data to controller
    query param: @RequestParam
	path param: {spitteId} and @PathVariable
	form param: 
	handle form
      action
      redirect vs forward
      validating with Java Validation API (Hibernate Validator implementation): @Valid
        built in
	    custom

redirect
  when? 
    want to redirect to other url (call other controller/static page - the model will lost)
	it is a new request
  want to pass model info when call redirect?
    using addFlashAttributes() from RedirectAttributes (is a Model)
  vs forward
    forward is still the same request/response with whole info
	process in server, url does not change
  PRG pattern: Post => Redirect (if need data - using RedirectAttributes) => Get
    avoid resubmit form
  


redering web view
  controller method ---- logical name view --- view implementation
  ViewResolver: resolve logical view name
  View: take the model, response to build the actual content
  13 built in view resolver implementation
