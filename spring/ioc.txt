One of the key themes of the Spring Framework is Inversion of Control (IoC). 
In its broadest sense, this means that the framework handles responsibilities on behalf of the components that are managed within its context. 
The components themselves are simplified, because they are relieved of those responsibilities. 
For example, dependency injection relieves the components of the responsibility of locating or creating their dependencies. 
Likewise, aspect-oriented programming relieves business components of generic cross-cutting concerns by modularizing them into reusable aspects. 
In each case, the end result is a system that is easier to test, understand, maintain, and extend.
