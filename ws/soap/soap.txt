Overview
  Web service vs standard website: 
    website for human interact while web service for code/application
    e.g. flight searching
  Java specification for web service
    rest: JAX-RS
    soap: JAX-WS
  how can I send argument and get result over different technologies?
    send through http (medium)
    and use same format (independent over technologies) to send/receiver data
  

wsdl: webservice description language
  like interface, tell consumer how to call (get/post…) webservice (server address, method name, argument, return type…). Say, when you create a webservice, you share the wsdl document for consumer, to know how to use your web service (generated by tool).
  elements of an wsdl file
    <definitions>
      <types>
         define complex types, if use only simple type w.g. string, number then may not use
      </types>
      <message>
         definition of a message....
      </message>
      <portType>
         <operation>
            definition of a operation.......  
         </operation>
      </portType>
      <binding>
         definition of a binding....
      </binding>
      <service>
         define end points e.g. access address
      </service>
    </definitions>
  how to test? using SoapUI
  how to view
    view: online viewer - to view operation, input, response
  how to generate
    normal
	in hybris
  soap vs soap12?
  use where in scpi?
    outbound message mapping: send some data, need to map to which service and which field? => scpi will generate a request like in SOAP UI to send to provider
