Overview
  Web service vs standard website: 
    website for human interact while web service for code/application
    e.g. flight searching
  Java specification for web service
    rest: JAX-RS
    soap: JAX-WS
  how can I send argument and get result over different technologies?
    send through http (medium)
    and use same format (independent over technologies) to send/receiver data

wsdl: webservice description language
  like interface, tell consumer how to call (get/post…) the webservice (server address, method name, argument, return type…). 
  Say, when you create a webservice, you share the wsdl document for consumer, to know how to use your web service (generated by tool).
  elements of an wsdl file
    <definitions>
      <types>: define the xml schema (xsd) for data type use in the file
      <message>: define which kind of message will be exchange, used in <portType>
	    e.g. 
	    <message name = "SayHelloRequest">
	      <part name = "firstName" type = "xsd:string"/>
	    </message>
      <portType>: define a logical webservice e.g. which message is sent? which message is returned?, used in <binding>
         e.g. <wsdl:portType name="CalculatorSoap">
		 4 types of operation
      </portType>
      <binding>: define physical webservice e.g. <portType> + transport protocol, used in service
      <service>: define the expose address for a binding
    </definitions>
  soap vs soap12 e.g. <soap12:address>
    to say that, my web service also support soap12 specification
  
  how to view and test and existing ws? SoapUI
  how to generate wsdl file?
    normal
	  tao moi
	  generate from java code e.g. wsgen
	in hybris
  generate sample client code from wsdl: SOAP UI
  generate sample server code from wsdl
  use where in scpi?
    outbound message mapping: send some data, need to map to which service and which field? => scpi will generate a request like in SOAP UI to send to provider
