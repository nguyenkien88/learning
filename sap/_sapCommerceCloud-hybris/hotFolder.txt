hot folder = scan periodically + auto processing
import line by line, 1 dong fail van process may dong khac
other way to import data to hybris, based on spring integration, periodically scan a predefined directory, if new file => processing
  e.g. critical business data such as master data, price, stock and order information need to be moved from external systems to SAP Hybris
  e.g. just place the file into a directory => import automatically
  
flow
  spring itegration will scan periodically e.g. <file:inbound-channel-adapter id="batchFilestmp" .../>
    with baseDirectorytmp e.g.D:\work\tmp\hybris2005V1\hybris\data\acceleratorservices\import\master\tmp
	and fileOrderComparator
  then files are moved to /processing order e.g. <file:outbound-gateway request-channel="batchFilestmp" reply-channel="batchFilestmpProc" ../>
  then the header is setup e.g. tmpHeaderSetupTask-HeaderSetupTask
  then the header is init e.g. headerInitTask-HeaderInitTask - init some info sequencedId, language for the header e.g. BatchHeader used during import process
  then trigger transform task e.g. batchTransformerTask - ImpexTransformerTask
    get the file from BatchHeader
	get converters by mapping file name prefix e.g. unit-en-2121.csv
	then convert to impex (header and impexRow setup in the converter) - ;{+0}  ;{+1}  ;{2}  ;{3} - + means mandatory
	and call cleanupHelper to remove file
  then trigger batchRunnerTask e.g. AbstractImpexRunnerTask to execute import (using ImportService) - multi-threads here
	custom filter/decorator/
	translator e.g. import unit value from external check by product code 
	are used in this step 
  then call cleanupHelper to clean transformed and source file (archive, error dir)

execute code for each line after import
  impex.legacy.scripting=false (neu thu bang hac => anable code execution)
