metadata, provide additional info for compiler/jvm
when use annotation (custom)?
  need to provide metadata for some work
  ex in map: excel export, buil query, transaction required, pdf

built in vs custom annotations
type annotations: @NonNull, @ReadOnly...(java 8) - any where used a type, not just declaration
kinds of annotations
  marker: do not have method
  single value: single method
  multi values

@Retention: set the visibility of the annotations
  SOURCE: only visible for compiler, disapear in .class (not visible at runtime)
  CLASS: store in .class, not visible at runtime - default, just is used for some tools thao tac voi bytecode
  RUN_TIME: store in .class and visible at runtime (mostly use this)
  
@Target: define where the annotation can be used
  TYPE: class, interface, enum
  METHOD
  CLASS
  FIELD
  ....

Other  
  @Documented: involve the annotation in javadoc
  @Inherited: parent using annotation (@Retention = TYPE) -> children also have this annotation
  @Repeatable
  Annotation processing tools

elements of annotations
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
  public @interface Hero {
    String name();
    int power() default 1000;
    
  }

How to write code using custom annotation?
  Write the annotation itself (@Column)
  Used it (Excel Importer)
  Using reflection to do the real work
