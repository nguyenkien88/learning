classpath: where compiler(javac)/jre(java) find .class file when compile/runtime
  javac with -classpath option: explicitly set where to search .class files (refer by other file)
    mac dinh compiler/jre search in same directory of the compile file  (and append package level of refered file)
  jre/compiler can look for independent .class file or .class file in a jar file
  when add lib to build path (eclipse) => add entry to .classpath file
  when compile file A that refer to file B -> neu B chua compile thi duoc compile luon
  (http://www.kevinboone.net/classpath.html)

  
java build path eclipse config
  specify dependency required to compile the project (from other projects, jar, folder contains .class files)
  Source folder: 
    contains .java file that will be compile to output folder (classes), thuong la code + test
	config resources (properties, images...) as source folder => duoc copy ra output folder, should added as regular folder (not src folder)
	can config with wildcard
  nen de scr and test ra 2 project khac nhau, vi can dependency khac nhau
  Project
    class inside required project can be refer (content assist and compile) from the owner project (axon ivy handle using maven)
  Order/Export
    truong hop owner used old library A, depended project uses new library A => order depended project over old lib to get new feature (can can dung old feature somewhere else)
    export: A contains lib B, A1 requires A, also needs lib B => A export B (cach khac la A add lib B by it own)	
	
.classpath file: define configuration for java class path: src folder/output folder/lib...
  when convert to Maven project => these info will change.
