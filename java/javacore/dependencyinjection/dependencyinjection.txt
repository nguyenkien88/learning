concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB8k2-Egfv0
  co ban: class A using class B (and other class similar to B), but A doesn't depend directly on B but on an inteface of B,
  (not depend directly on instance of class B)
  the real B instance will be injected to A by other piece of code (run time).
  class A doesn't initialize class B directly

how? with guice or spring
guice
  static binding (1 implementation)
    bind using Guice Module (winner if using both)
    @ImplementedBy
  dynamic binding (conditional/run time) with provider: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uAR5sFgh2A&t=19s
