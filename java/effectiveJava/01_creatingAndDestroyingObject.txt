Consider static factory methods instead of constructor (e.g. Boolean.valueOf())
  Advantages
    factory methods have name => clear, think about class with 2 or more constructors => confuse
	Do not required create object moi lan call (e.g. Boolean.valueOf()) => performance
	
Consider builder when constructor have many parameter
  telescope constructor => kho doc, dễ nhầm
  setter => not atomic construction => inconsistence state
  => using builder (fluent api)
    normal
	with class hierachy (later)
	
Singleton with
  public field, private constructor
  private field, private constructor, public getInstance()
    think about Serialization
  Single element enum  
	
Non instantiability utitlity classes?
  using abstract? no, because subclass can be instantialize. abstract should be for inheritance
  => shoule use private constructor (and final class to signle not to inheritance)
