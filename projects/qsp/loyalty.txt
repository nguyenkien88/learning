correct way to implement addon store front? using component? (tham khao ootb addon)
  using cms component: e.g. create navigation node that links to addon contentpage component
  ve co ban when buil, only storefront resources are copy to main storefront, other files keeps
  problem
    
update tier: cron job completed order only 

get code from lmfc repo
=> copy memembership addon qua qspj
=> install, add to localextensions.xml
=> clean all, update system
=> run impex (5 file - 1 failed: cms-responsive-content_en)

ant addoninstall -Daddonnames="membershipaddon" -DaddonStorefront.yacceleratorstorefront="qspjstorefront"


add to second storefront?

bug
  cash on delivery do not create consigment - hien tai ko split consignment for cod
    how to complet order?
  credicart complete order failed
  

create loyalty tranction
  credit card: place order
    trigger order process run ??((then run consigment process)
	  that goes through: payWithLoyaltyPointsAction
	    that publish event LoyaltyOrderEvent
		  that trigger LoyaltyOrderEventListener
			and get the loyaltyAccuralService (DefaultLoyaltyAccuralService - with LoyaltyOrderEventStrategy)
		      that calll LoyaltyOrderEventStrategy.accrual()
			    that will call processLoyaltyRule() - change facts here
				  that will call loyaltyEngineService to run rule (call commerceRuleEngineService to execute rule)
			        that will update the LoyaltyTransactionModel (populate to LoyaltyTransactionData later to show to ui)
				
  cod
