think as an distributed database
say, blockchain implementations e.g. etherium

a block
  index
  timestamp
  data
  previousHash
  hash

genesis block

validation
  temper
  proof of work: make the Block creating (mining block) harder - using nonce (change the value of data to change hash util meet condition)

mining reward
