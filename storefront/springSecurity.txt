  the actual work is done by an AuthenticationProvider
  
in hybris
  authentication (verify identity - login)
  vs authorization (access right after authentication)
  CoreAuthenticationProvider (use userdetails service here)
  AcceleratorAuthenticationProvider
    preventing administrators from authentication in storefront (searchRestrictions do not apply for administrators, which leads to catalog version ambiguities)
  after success
    GUID cookie is added (GUIDAuthenticationSuccessHandler)
	then calls StoreFrontAuthenticationSuccessHandler for cart restoration or merging   
  automactic login: after register success
  
  remember me (soft login): TokenBasedRememberMeServices
    closes the browser without logging out
    use cookie

	redirecting to a Requested URL After Authentication: https://tinyurl.com/y4289rlu
  
  GUIDInterceptor (spring-mvc-config.xml)
    For paths contained in the excludeUrls property, the existence of the GUID cookie is not enforced
	All remaining paths trigger a redirect to the loginUrl if called on a secure channel without the GUID cookie set
