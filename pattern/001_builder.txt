problem
  initialize object with constructor arguments => too many args => un-readable
  using many setters => verbose
  
when used?
  constructor with many arguments
  call setter many times
  
pattern: 
  BankAccountBuilder.createBankAccount.hasAccountNumber()...
  hold private BankAccount
  has private constructor
  has static method to get the builder it self
  has buil/get method to the actual BankAccount
  
  public class GirlBuilder {
    
    private Girl girl = new Girl();
    
    private GirlBuilder() {
    }
    
    public static GirlBuilder createGirl() {
      return new GirlBuilder();
    }
    
    public Girl get() {
      return girl;
    }
    
    public GirlBuilder hasName(String name) {
      girl.setName(name);
      return this;
    }
    
    public GirlBuilder hasAge(int age) {
      girl.setAge(age);
      return this;
    }
    
  }
