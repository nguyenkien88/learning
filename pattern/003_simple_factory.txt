creational group
when? see if/else when create object in caller method (thuc chat cung chi la move xuong other class)

ex: 
create Transaction Wizard Handler (TransactionWizardBean)
public static ITransactionWizardHandler TransactionWizardHandlerFactory.createTransactionWizardHandler(fProject, transaction);
based on transaction type => create (return) right handler
//caller doesn't know how the handler is created

move logic that responsible for creating object base on condition ra class chuyên dụng
=> encapsulate what varies
=> sau nay change code thi change 1 cho nay
